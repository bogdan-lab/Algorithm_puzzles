#Not finished tasks

 - **Pallet_storage** -- still have no ideas how to do it in less than n^2. Sorting is useless because of the example [10, 1], [6, 5], [3, 2]. Splitting and deleting pallets which I can situate on others is laso useless because of the pallet set where no pallet can be situated on another.
